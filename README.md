# Worker Payment Slip Generator

## Overview

This project contains two scripts (Python and R) that dynamically generate payment slips for 400 workers based on gender and salary conditions.

## Files

- `payment_slips.R`: R version of the script performing the same task.
- `payment_slips.csv`: Output file containing the generated payment slips.
- `README.txt`: Instructions and overview.

## Instructions

### Python

1. Run the `payment_slips.py` script in any Python 3 environment.
2. The script will generate a `payment_slips.csv` file containing the output.

### R

1. Open `payment_slips.R` in any R environment (e.g., RStudio).
2. Run the script to generate the same output in R.

Ensure you have `pandas` installed in Python:
